# 1.1) Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

def allUnique(s):
	# Corner case: string has zero characters
	if len(s) == 0:
		return 'String has no characters!'

	# Base case: string has only one character
	if len(s) == 1:
		return 'String has all unique characters!'

	if s in set(s) and len(s) == len(set(s)):
		return 'String has all unique characters!'
	
	return 'String does not have all unique characters!'

# Short and pythonic way of answer the question
def allUniquePythonic(s):
    return len(s) == len(set(s))

# Without using additional data structures
def allUniqueDictionary(s):
    s = s.replace(' ', '')
    chars = set()
    
    for c in s:
        if c in chars:
            return false
        else:
            chars.add(c)
    return true
